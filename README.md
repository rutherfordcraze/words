# Words
Generates words from a limited character set

`$ python words.py`

Input: characters a-z, can be space-separated, in any order, duplicates are fine.

Output: space-separated words (not always scrabble-compliant).

`dictionary.json` is a public-domain list of English words modified from [this file](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_dictionary.json). I have removed the _n_ and _c_ words, but there are probably some unsavoury utterances still in there.
